onboarding:
Invitation Link > Members join > stripe sends invoice for subscription

Coupon for users that join on or before December 31st, reduced cost forever, 5$ off (actually expires Jan 1st 2021)

canceled subscription:
removes user from circle

VIP upgrade:
Circle new comment posted in specific space on a specific topic  > update subscription in stripe > give user vip tag & access to spaces

Zapier does not support updating subscriptions with stripe, so there are a few workarounds.

VIP subscription in stripe is an additional subscription for 20$, the user will have both the basic subscription and the vip, for a total of 30$
early access users will still get 5$ off the base subscription making a vip total 25$

The caveat is there is no way to downgrade besides canceling the subscription, which removes them from the circle.

VIP users that cancel will need to cancel both regular and VIP subscriptions, the first sub they cancel will remove them from the circle.

All these workarounds could have been avoided if Zapier had an update subscription action for stripe.

It needs to be clear to the user ANY comment on the upgrade topic will start a monthly subscription, to help with that I wrote some javascript to remove the reply button from that topic's comments.
made it so you cannot reply to comments on the upgrade topic


TODO:

downgrade from vip:
there is no downgrade zapier doesnt have update subscription

Tax?
