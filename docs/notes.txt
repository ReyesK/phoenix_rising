onboarding:
send user to sarahspeaksup.com/phoenix-rising > user fills out a stripe hosted payment page > on new customer trigger (successful payment) > invite member to circle (they would get an email)

canceled subscription:
removes user from circle

VIP upgrade:
user clicks button on topic in circle > user fills out stripe hosted payment page > new customer triggers in stripe > tag member in circle > add member to space group

Important notes:
Zapier does not support updating subscriptions with stripe, so there are a few workarounds.

VIP subscription in stripe is an additional subscription for $19.99 +tax, the user will have both the basic subscription and the vip, for a total of $29.99(+tax)
early access users will still get 5$ off the base subscription making a vip total $24.99(+tax)

The caveat is there is no way to downgrade besides canceling the subscription, which removes them from the circle.

VIP users that cancel will need to cancel both regular and VIP subscriptions, the first sub they cancel will remove them from the circle.

All these workarounds could have been avoided if Zapier had an update subscription action for stripe.

TODO:

downgrade from vip:
there is no downgrade zapier doesnt have update subscription

make the elevated stripe button success a page within the elevated circle group, cancel can be the upgrade topic
